fast-downward is a library for modelling classical planning problems and solving them using the [Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org) engine. For general usage, see [`FastDownward`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fast-downward-0.1.0.0/docs/FastDownward.html), and for an example see [`FastDownward.Examples.Gripper`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fast-downward-0.1.0.0/docs/FastDownward-Examples-Gripper.html).

Note that usage of this library requires the downward executable - see [Obtaining and Running Fast Downward](http://www.fast-downward.org/ObtainingAndRunningFastDownward) for more instructions.
